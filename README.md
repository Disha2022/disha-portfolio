## User Story

## Project Description
Purpose of this project is to build a portfolio to showcase projects for securing a position as software developer.

## Tools
1. CSS
2. HTML

## index.html
1. Created framework for portfolio and created the portfolio from the scratch.
2. Added header elements and linked them with the appropriate sections.
3. Added background image and scaled it with the profile picture (class="Reso").

6. Added links for the project images.

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
